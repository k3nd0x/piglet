### Getting Started with Piglet 🐷

When you initiate Piglet for the first time, an admin user will be automatically generated with a default password. You can customize the default domain using the `{DOMAIN}` environment variable.

To access the Piglet interface, simply enter the IP address of your server into your browser. By default, the web UI is accessible at [http://127.0.0.1/](http://127.0.0.1/).

The default login credentials are:

- **Username:** admin@{DOMAIN}
- **Password:** admin

If you prefer not to use the admin account, you have the option to create a new user directly on the registration page.

Upon initial setup, each user is provided with a default budget named `MyBudget` and a predefined category called `Groceries`.

To collaborate on budgets with friends, check out the [Budgets](04-Budgets.md) section.
