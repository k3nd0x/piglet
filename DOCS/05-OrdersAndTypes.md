### Orders and Types üê∑

To add orders to Piglet, navigate to [http://127.0.0.1/new-order](http://127.0.0.1/new-order).

Currently, there are two different types of orders (soon to be three) you can make:

#### Normal Orders
Just enter the value you spend and categorize it. Optionally, you can also add a description. The date of the order will be set to the current date and time of your browser.

#### Future Spends
If you choose a future spend order, you have to select a date in the future when the order is expected. On the selected date, the order will be added to the normal order list.

#### Recurring Orders
In Piglet v1.3, you will be able to add recurring orders. Choose from daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly, and yearly intervals. Piglet v1.3 will be announced soon.
