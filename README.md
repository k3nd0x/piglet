# How to start
#### With Docker
The Image is available at `k3nd0x/piglet`. \
All relevant webapp data is in the container image.

The mariadb image is the official image from the MariaDB Foundation. \
To keep the data consistent you only have to store the mariadb data (`/var/lib/mysql`) locally. (See volume config in docker-compose file) \
In the `.env` file you have to set our private data like mysql_password and mysql_user. 

You can use the `docker-compose.yml` to create both containers: `docker-compose up -d`

At the first startup a database will be created with the data from the `.env` file and some default data will be imported.
Possible env variables you can see at the .env example file.

- html/css mobile friendly
- add some more features to reports
- password change over webui
- SQLite as database #10

# Disclaimer

I started to build this project at the beginning of my programming career so please be gentle if something is not working as expected.
Feel free to edit or just open a issue. Feature requests can also be added at the issue tab.

Currently "unsecure cookie setting" is activated to allow a login over http per default.
If you want to access your piglet instance over the internet I highly recommend to access the site over a reverse proxy with https.
If you accessing the piglet instance over https please disable "unsecure cookie setting". Just set the env var `SECURE_COOKIE` to True (default: False).
